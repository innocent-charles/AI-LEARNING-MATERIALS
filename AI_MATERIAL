CHAPTER ONE 
INTRODUCTION TO THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,ROBOTICS AND DATA 

application of the artificial intelligence 
-Image processing
-Image classification 
-Speech recognization 
-Face recognization 
-Natural Languge processing 
-Object detection 
-Robotics 
 *Physical robotics 
 *Software Robotics 
-Self Driving car 



-The AI associated with the technology such as 
 -Big Data
 -Blockchain
 -IOT(Internet of Things)
 -Cloud Computing 


 
DEFINITION AND SCOPE OF THE AI 
The history of the AI started in 1950's 
dfn-The AI is the study of the computer science that a machines and computer program imitating,agumenting and partial replacing the human intelligence.



CATEGORIES AND TYPE OF THE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE 
-LOGICAL MATHEMATICS 
-VISUAL SPARTIAL
-BODILY KINAESTHETICS
-VERBAL LINGUSTICS 
-INTERPERSONAL
-MUSICAL RHYRHIMIC 


->But basically the human inteligences concerns with the Thinking and Acting  !!!!,
Example thinking done by the brain,neurons,
Example acting done by the  arms,legs and the other part of the body,



_>The keys or main purpose of the articial intelligences are 
1.Replacing the Acting and Thinking of the human by the machines and computer program. 
2.Agumenting the acting and thinking of the human by the machines and the computer programs.



TYPES OF THE AI AND THE BASIC TERMINOLOGY 

CATEGORIES OF THE AI SOLUTION 
1.COGNITIVE SOLUTIONS 
-These responding to the Thinking.

2.ROBOTICS SOLUTION 
-These corresponding to the human acting.

Weak AI-it is far from the actual human intelligence ,But for today world we are in weak AI .This is also called artificial narrow intelligence 

Strong AI -it is near to the human intelligence ,this does not exist yet ,,it is just a concept,vision and it does not clearly stated whether we will be reaching in this stage of Ai .This is also called the artificial general intelligence 


CHAPTER TWO 
THE MOST RELEVANT AI TECHNOLOGIES 
1.Physical Robots 
-These includes the machines that can perform the tasks in the physical world.
They are used in :
 -Industrial production 
 -used in logistics ,retail and services sector 
 -it used in human like robots like android,gynoids,and Humanoid.
2.Software Robots 
 -it includes RPA,,Robot processing Automation 
3.Speech recognization and processing 
  -Speech to text transcription 
  -Real time translation 
  -Personal assistants 
  -Chatbots
  -Voice ID
  -Voice Diagnosis 
  -NLP 
 
4.Image recognization and processing as well as computer vision .
 -Logistics
 -Medicine
 -Agricultural 
 -Face Recognization 
 
5.Machine Learning 
6.Deep Learning 


HYPERAUTOMATION AND RPA(ROBITC PROCESS AUTOMATION)
-manual process are -slow
                    -expensive
                    -human can make errors 
                    -unefficients 


HYPERAUTOMATION-AUTOMATION ENABLED BY AI 

process modelling-
process mining   - 

RPA has numerous advantages as it :-
                                   it increases the speed and accuracy of the production 
                                   
                                   -and reduces the cost 
                                   



TYPE OF THE RPA 
-Unattended Bot -These are not directly triggered by the human operator(un assisted bot),it triggered by the other bot in a predefined way 



-Attended Bot  -These are the Bot that are directly triggered by the human operator 


4 WAYS TO BUILT RPA BOT 
-Coding 
-Graphical user interface 
-Recording 
-Self learning bot
